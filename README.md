# Gesture Controlled Robot

## Table of Content

## Description
The operation of the robot, consists in taking over the data from the accelerometer by the Arduino board of the controller according to its orientation, and this data will be transmitted to the robot through the radio transmitter module. 

The data is taken over by the radio receiver and will be sent to the Arduino board of the robot, then through the connecting wires will be sent electrical signals to the H-bridge circuit to operate the two DC motors.

## Build

## Binary files

This table provides an overview of the files generated during the build process using Arduino CLI.

| **File Type**         | **Description**                                        |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `.hex`                | Compiled binary in Intel HEX format for uploading to the board. |
| `.elf`                | Executable and Linkable Format file, includes debugging information. |
| `.bin`                | Raw binary file for flashing.                         |
| `.eep`                | EEPROM file containing data for EEPROM memory.        |
| `.map`                | Memory map file showing detailed memory usage.        |
