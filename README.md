# gesture-controlled-robot

The operation of the robot, which is in fact a mini car in prototype stage, consists in taking over the data from the accelerometer by the Arduino board of the controller according to its orientation, and this data will be transmitted to the robot through the radio transmitter module. 

The data is taken over by the radio receiver and will be sent to the Arduino board of the robot, then through the connecting wires will be sent electrical signals to the H-bridge circuit to operate the two DC motors.
